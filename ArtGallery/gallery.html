      <p class="description">Jean-Paul Marat was assassinated on July 13, 1793, by Charlotte Corday, who tricked him into meeting her by claiming to have information on counter-revolutionaries. Marat, suffering from a skin condition that required him to sit in a bathtub, was killed by a dagger to the chest while in his bath. The event was famously captured in Jacques-Louis David's painting, The Death of Marat, which portrays Marat as a martyr for the French Revolution.</p>

      <img src="assets/galleries/gallery_medusa.jpg" alt="The Raft of the Medusa">
      <p class="description">The Raft of the Medusa is a large-scale oil painting by French artist Théodore Géricault, created in 1818–1819. It depicts the gruesome aftermath of the 1816 shipwreck of the French frigate Medusa, showing a group of survivors on a makeshift raft after being abandoned by the ship's captain and crew. The painting is an iconic example of French Romanticism and caused a major scandal when it was first exhibited due to its macabre realism and political implications.</p>

      <p class="description">Liberty Leading the People is a large oil painting by Eugène Delacroix, created in 1830 to commemorate the July Revolution of 1830 in France. It is a defining work of French Romanticism, symbolizing freedom and democracy through the allegorical figure of Liberty, a bare-breasted woman holding the tricolor flag and a bayonet as she leads a diverse group of revolutionaries over a barricade.</p>

      <p class="description">The Mona Lisa is a 1503–1519 oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci, housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. It depicts Lisa del Giocondo (née Gherardini), a Florentine merchant's wife, and is famous for its enigmatic smile, achieved through da Vinci's use of the sfumato technique. Its fame was significantly amplified after it was stolen in 1911 and recovered two years later.</p>

      <p class="description">The School of Athens is a masterpiece fresco by Raphael painted between 1509 and 1511 in the Vatican's Stanza della Segnatura. The painting depicts philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists from ancient Greece, with central figures Plato and Aristotle engaged in debate. Commissioned by Pope Julius II, it represents the harmony between classical philosophy and Christian thought and is one of four frescoes in the room that symbolize different branches of human knowledge.</p>

      <img src="assets/galleries/gallery_judithslaying.jpg" alt="Judith Slaying Holofernes">
      <p class="description">Judith Slaying Holofernes is a famous biblical scene, most notably depicted in paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi and Caravaggio. The story, from the Book of Judith, tells of the Jewish widow Judith who saves her city by beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes after he gets drunk in her tent. Gentileschi's version, a powerful example of Baroque art, emphasizes the violence and strength of the women, and some interpret it as a reflection of her own past trauma, while others focus on its depiction of female power.</p>

      <img src="assets/galleries/gallery_saintmichael.jpg" alt="Saint Michael Vanquishing Satan">
      <p class="description">"Saint Michael Vanquishing Satan" is a religious theme and a specific artwork by Raphael, depicting the Archangel Michael's victory over the devil. This event is described in the Book of Revelation, where Michael and his angels defeat Satan, casting him and his followers out of heaven. Raphael's 1518 painting, located in the Louvre, is a famous interpretation of this theme, showing Michael triumphantly standing on Satan.</p>
